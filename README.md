# 22mm-shaft-to-70mm-PCD-adapter
This repository contains the design files for a two-part adapter that allows for the mounting of steering wheels with a 70mm PCD bolt pattern onto 22mm shafts. The aim is to provide a simple, low-budget solution for DIY direct-drive wheel bases.  

## Features:
- Three-piece design for easy installation. Compatible with standard 70mm PCD steering wheels and 22mm shafts

## Important:
- You will need to use an expanding shaft lock in order to secure these plates to the 22-32 expansion sleeve shaft lock. Adapter design may not be compatible with all clamp types, so I will try my best to provide some links to the ones that do work.

- These expanding shaft locks rely on a hole around the narrow section to compress the sleeve. To improve clamping and security, a hollow spacer tube (ID = 32mm, L = 25mm) can be added around the narrow section of the clamp to help distribute force and hold the steering wheel more firmly.
  
## Acknowledgment:
This design was inspired by a great model I found on Printables by user @mkr_408675. I very much appreciate the thought that went into their original work. While this version was made to suit my own needs and manufacturing process, credit is due for the original idea.
